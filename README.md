# Group-Project-Summative-Data-Analysis

We have used this dataset link mentioned below in bold which has different csv files, but in more specific we have used this file: "GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity". In addition, we made graphs which compared the average temperatures of different countries and city's to each other. Moreover, to see how being in different parts of the hemosphere and/or being accross an ocean would affect its average temperature throughout the years. Additionalty, we have also included a world map which shows the average temperature of each area in the world. Lastly, we have also included comments throughout the code in order, to explain what we did for each different grapgh and we also explained what the each piece of code does.
